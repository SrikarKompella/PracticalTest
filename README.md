A CRUD web application using J2EE, JSP and MySQL. Ran some unit testing on CRUD operations.
Libraries and Frameworks used:
Spring MVC
Spring JDBC

Used StackOverflow to rectify setup, dependency and coding errors. It is tedious to mention every search here, but it was used the most. I used a lot of material from my previous projects as well.
